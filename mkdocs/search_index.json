You can access the root of your system by selecting \nFuzzy Nav\n.  If you would like access Fuzzy File Nav but have it start in the current direct of the open file, you can select \nFuzzy Nav Here\n.  If you would like to open the bookmark menu with your custom defined folders, you can select \nFuzzy BookMarks\n.\n\n\nSuggested Accessibility Shortcuts\n\n\nYou can create shortcuts to access FuzzyFileNav Quickly, some examples are shown below.\n\n\nFor Windows/Linux:\n\n\n    \n[\n\n        \n{\n \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nctrl+o\n],\n \ncommand\n:\n \nfuzzy_start_from_file\n \n},\n\n        \n{\n \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nctrl+shift+o\n],\n \ncommand\n:\n \nfuzzy_bookmarks_load\n \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor OSX:\n\n\n    \n[\n\n        \n{\n \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nsuper+o\n],\n \ncommand\n:\n \nfuzzy_start_from_file\n \n},\n\n        \n{\n \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nsuper+shift+o\n],\n \ncommand\n:\n \nfuzzy_bookmarks_load\n \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Bookmarks\n\n\nFuzzyFileNav you can bring up a list of bookmarked folders.  To add or change the bookmark list, simply add/change the entries in the settings file \nfuzzy_file_nav.sublime-settings\n. Required parameters are \nname\n and \npath\n.\n\n\n    \n// Bookmarked paths\n\n    \nbookmarks\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\nname\n:\n \nMy Computer\n,\n \npath\n:\n \n},\n\n        \n{\nname\n:\n \nRoot\n,\n \npath\n:\n \n/\n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf it is desired to have specific bookmarks show up only on a specific OS or a specific host, you can augment the \npath\n option using the notation below.

Options are \nbookmarks\n, \nhome\n, \nroot\n.\n\n    \nstart_from_here_default_action\n:\n \nbookmarks\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nHome folder can be accessed any time by typing \n~/\n into the FuzzyFileNav quick panel. \n\n\nHome folder can be configured for multiple OS and/or hosts.  Simply use the notation below and see \nPlatform/Computer Specific Settings\n for more information.\n\n\n    \nhome\n:\n \n{\n#multiconf#\n:\n \n[{\nos:windows\n:\n \nc:\\\\Some\\\\Location\n},\n \n{\nos:linux\n:\n \n/Some/Linux/Location\n}]},\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform/Computer Specific Settings\n\n\nCurrently the \nhome\n settings in the settings file, and the \npath\n setting in a bookmark entry can be configured to have multiple OS and/or host specific settings to help manage settings across different machines.\n\n\nThe syntax to configure one of these settings to be OS and/or host specific is found below:\n\n\n\n\nThe setting should be a key/value pair, where the key is \n#multiconf#\n and the value is an array of key/value entries whose keys describe the host and/or os qualifiers needed for the value to be used.\n\n\nThe key/value entries will have a key that represents one or more qualifiers, each of which must be separated with a \n;\n\n\nEach qualifier consists of the qualifier type and a qualifier value to compare against.  These will be separated by a \n:\n.\n\n\nThere are two supported qualifiers: \nhost\n and \nos\n.  \nhost\n is the name of your PC.  \nos\n is the platform and can be either \nwindows\n, \nlinux\n, or \nosx\n.\n\n\nThe key/value entries will have a value associated with the key, and can be of any type: string, number, array, dictionary, etc.\n\n\n\n\nexample:\n\n\n    \nhome\n:\n \n{\n#multiconf#\n:\n \n[{\nos:windows\n:\n \nc:\\\\Some\\\\Location\n},\n \n{\nos:linux\n:\n \n/Some/Linux/Location\n}]},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuzzyFileNav Panel Features\n\n\nThere are a number of features accessible by shortcuts when the FuzzyFileNav Panel is open.  Most shortcuts are combinations of the modifier key \nctrl\n; for OSX simply replace the \nctrl\n modifier with \nsuper\n.\n\n\nToggle the showing/hiding of hidden files.\n\n\nctrl\n + \nh\n Toggle the showing/hiding of hidden files defined by the system or by regex from settings file.\n\n\nShow Fuzzy Bookmarks\n\n\nctrl\n + \nb\n Show the Fuzzy Nav Bookmarks panel.\n\n\nFuzzy File Name Complete\n\n\ntab\n or \nshift\n + \ntab\n Complete the file name being typed (shift modifier cycles backwards).  If the current typed name matches one or more file/folders, tab will complete it.  Saddly it cannot tab into the currently selected fuzzy results, but it will tab through close options.\n\n\nNavigate Folders\n\n\n/\n When you have a completed file name typed, you can type a slash after the name and you will descend into the folder.  Windows can also use \n\\\n which will do the same thing.  You can also descend into folders by simply selected them in the nave panel.\n\n\nFuzzy File Delete\n\n\nctrl\n + \nd\n Deletes the folder/file object currently typed (full name) in the Fuzzy File Nav panel.\n\n\nFuzzy File Copy\n\n\nctrl\n + \nc\n Copies the folder/file object currently typed (full name) file in the Fuzzy File Nav panel.  A Fuzzy File Paste must be performed to complete the copy.\n\n\nFuzzy File Cut\n\n\nctrl\n + \nx\n Cuts (moves) the folder/file object currently typed (full name) file in the Fuzzy File Nav panel.  A Fuzzy File Paste must be performed to complete the cut (move).\n\n\nFuzzy File Paste\n\n\nctrl\n + \nv\n Completes the copying and pasting of the folder/file object that is in the clipboard.  The file/folder will be pasted into the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  To rename the folder/file object on paste, type the full name that should be used before pressing \nctrl\n + \nv\n.\n\n\nFuzzy Make File\n\n\nctrl\n + \nn\n Creates a new file in the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  The name that is typed into the panel is the name that will be used.\n\n\nFuzzy Make Folder\n\n\nctrl\n + \nshift\n + \nn\n Creates a new folder in the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  The name that is typed into the panel is the name that will be used.\n\n\nFuzzy Save As File\n\n\nctrl\n + \ns\n Saves view to the the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  The name that is typed into the panel is the name of the file the view will be saved to.  You will be prompted for file overwrite.\n\n\nFuzzy Current Working View\n\n\nctrl\n + \n.\n Gets the file name of the current working view and copies it to the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.",
